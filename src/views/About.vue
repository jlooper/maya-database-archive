			<p>Welcome, music teachers!</p>
			<p>
				Teachers are considered such if they have students assigned to them in the app. A student must add a
				teacher's email address to their settings by searching for your email address in the 'My Teacher' tab.
			</p>
			<p>
				Teachers can view practices students complete in their main dashboard. Use the 'trophy' icon to award a
				sticker, or the 'pen' icon to write a short note to give feedback.
			</p>
			<p>
				You can listen to a student's practice session if they send it to you by their personal email. They are
				able to record a few minutes of their session for you on the web site, download it, and email it to you.
			</p>
			<p>
				If a student has indicated in their settings screen that they want to notify you about each practice
				session, you will be sent an email after each one and a special one if a student achieves a goal.
			</p>
			<p>Not receiving emails? Check your spam or junk mail folders to whitelist the emails.</p>

			<p>Welcome, music students!</p>
			<p>Practice Buddy app guides you to complete practice goals and communicate with your teacher.</p>
			<p>
				Select your teacher via the 'My Teacher' page in the left navigation. Type in their email and if they
				have registered for an account, their name will be selectable on the screen.
			</p>
			<p>
				Fill out the Settings area before starting to practice. How long should each practice last, in minutes?
				How many times do you need to practice to earn a reward? Ask your parent or teacher for guidance.
			</p>
			<p>
				If you'd like to record part of your practice session to share, click the 'record' button. The app asks
				for your permission to record, and once granted, it will record a few minutes of your session. You can
				then download the file you like, save it to your local computer, and then attach it to an email sent
				from your account.
			</p>
			<p>
				Your teacher will give you practice feedback and award stickers; those will show on your main dashboard.
				Blue colored practices are practices in pursuit of a goal; red colored practices are ones that helped
				you achieve a goal. You can archive old practices.
			</p>
			<p>Enjoy your practice experience!</p>
